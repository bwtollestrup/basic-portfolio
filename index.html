        <p>Hello.</p>
    
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio. Here you will find a collection of my work as I begin my journey of web development.</p> 
        
        <p>A little bit about me. I was born in Billings, Montana and have had the pleasure of living in 6 states; Montana, Illinois, Utah, New Mexico, California, and Idaho. I currently call Salt Lake City home but am itching to move to the Pacific Northwest. I enjoy the simple things in life and am easily distracted by shiny things. People watching is one of my favorite past times and I am always looking for good food, good wine, and an even better time. I live for the moments you can’t put into words with people you don’t forget. I am a dog lover, avid reader, and tea enthusiast.</p>

        <p>Thanks for stopping by, I hope you like what you see.</p>
